        "Dr. Li\u2019s long-term research goal is to understand the host-microbiome interactions and how these interactions contribute to the host phenotypes in both genetic and nutritional contexts. Over the years, he has uniquely positioned himself through multidisciplinary research to be successful in this area: he is investigating the evolutionary relationships of the symbiont Limosilactobacillus reuteri with vertebrate hosts; he is evaluating the effects of a microbiome restoration strategy that includes a non-industrialized-type diet and the probiotics of L. reuteri, on the gut microbiome and host health; he is also comparing the influence of different dietary fibers on health in overweight people, and determining if these effects are predictable through individual signatures of the gut microbiome. During his PhD program, he applied novel omics (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing) to characterize the gut microbiome and its linkages with host phenotypes and genotypes in ruminants. He successfully established bioinformatics pipelines for these cutting-edge omics approaches, and revealed linkages between rumen microbiome and feed efficiency in cattle. His study also revealed the host genetic effect on the rumen microbiome, highlighting the potential to manipulate the gut microbiome through selective breeding of the hosts."
