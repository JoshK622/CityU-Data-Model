        "My research focuses on both the methodological development of an integrated brain stimulation and multimodal brain imaging method, and the application of this method to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain in change detection and prediction violation processes. Specifically, I examines the memory and attention processes involved in detecting changes in environmental stimulation (i.e., deviance or change detection), and the neural substrates underlying those processes. Stimulus deviance ranges from simple physical anomalies (e.g., tone change) to violation of abstract rules (e.g., syntactic violations) and, in conjunction with appropriate brain imaging techniques, can be used as a tool to investigate how the brain processes information across the continuum of complexity from simple stimulus perception to abstract pattern comprehension (e.g., language). In order to investigate the interactions and causal connections between different brain regions across time, I apply multimodal imaging methods, where I use an optical brain imaging method, the event-related optical signals (EROS), primarily, and combine it with electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infra red spectroscopy (fNIRS), or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) where suitable."
