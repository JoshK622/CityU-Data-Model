        "Dr. Sam H. Y. Hsu\u2019s research interests involve the material design, synthesis, processing, imaging, spectroscopy and solar energy application, aiming to explore fundamental properties and interactions of organic and inorganic materials for developing efficient solar energy conversion processes. He has keen interests in photoinduced charge transfer processes, interfacial electron transfer, electrochemical hydrogen generation, and photoredox reactions for electricity generation, solar fuel production, wastewater treatment as well as food waste management. The investigations between material phenomena rely heavily on concepts of energy and environmental engineering, consisting of photophysics, electrochemistry, photoelectrochemistry by utilizing scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging, ultrafast transient absorption (TA), time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) and so forth."
