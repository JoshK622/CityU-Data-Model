        "Carl's research interests lie broadly in critical discourse studies, particularly in multimodal approaches to the analysis of corporate and political discourses. His current research focuses on how affect is cultivated and appropriated for corporate and political objectives, as part of a broader affective governance oriented towards the (self-)regulation of individual and collective affective dispositions in a neoliberal context. He is also interested in issues of identity in a context of contemporary capitalism, especially in advanced Asian capitalist societies like Singapore and Hong Kong."
