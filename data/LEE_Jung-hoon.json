        "The ability to control the physical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles allows us to produce materials with specific optical, magnetical, and electrical properties. Considerable progress has been made in synthesizing plasmonic nanoparticles possessing fascinating optical properties, however, it is still highly challenging to precisely and reproducibly synthesize and assemble them into well de\ufb01ned structures at nanometer scale, which make them ideal platforms for various biomedical applications. Dr. Lee`s research aim is to develop and design new plasmonic nanomaterials and understand a synthetic mechanism and property of them, but also to find applied research fields for synthesized materials. His current research interests include:",
        " ",
        "- Development of new synthetic methods of plasmonic nanomaterials with multi-function for biomedical applications",
        "- Plasmonic photothermal-based fast and reliable assay methods to detect biomolecules such as antigens, antibodies, DNA",
        "- Selective and directional assembly of nanoparticles with DNA, salt, polymer encapsulation, selective deposition of metal on nanostructures"
