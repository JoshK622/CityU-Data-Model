        "Using elastic and inelastic neutron scattering as the main research tool, Prof. BAO has investigated frontier issues of correlated electronic phenomena in condensed matter, including the Mott metal-insulator transition, giant magnetoresistivity, orbital ordering, re-entrant spin-glass state, itinerant antiferromagnetism, low-dimensional quantum antiferromagnetism and unconventional superconductivity in heavy-fermion, cuprate and iron-based materials, often under extreme condition at low temperature, high pressure and high magnetic field. These works have led to more than 200 invited talks in US, Europe, Asia and Oceania.",
        "He has also led the design and construction of a suite of innovative cold-neutron inelastic spectrometers at China Advanced Research Reactor in Beijing as the PI of a 111 million\uffe5 National Key Research Infrastructure Project."
