        "My research investigates principles of organization/mechanics in animal muscle-skeletal systems, deriving core concepts in biology and evolution, but also principles relevant for biomedicine, engineering and design. Our group's multidisciplinary studies include investigations of animal biomechanics down to tissue material analyses, applying engineering, computer science and materials science to the natural sciences."
