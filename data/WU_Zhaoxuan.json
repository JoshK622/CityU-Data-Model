        "I work on problems in solid mechanics and materials from atomistic to continuum scales, focusing on dislocation, plasticity and fracture in engineering metals and alloys. I develop interatomic potentials in modified embedded-atom method formalism with density functional theory validations for simulating dislocation and fracture phenomena. My recent interests are studying dislocation core, crack-tip, fracture behaviors and alloying effects in hcp metals. In the previous years, I studied deformation and microstructure evolution of nanocrystalline metals using very large scale atomistic simulations."
