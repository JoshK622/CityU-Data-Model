        "Professor Ou is a leading expert in quantum optics. He is specialized in quantum interference and is famous for the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. He pioneered the field of multi-photon interference, which he summarized in the monograph \"Quantum Multi-Photon Interference\" published by Springer in 2007. Professor Ou recently demonstrated experimentally another novel type of quantum interferometer known as \"SU(1,1) interferometer\", which has since been realized with a variety of waves such as atomic spin wave and matter wave, phonon, microwave, etc. Professor Ou's current research focuses on the application of this new interferometer to quantum metrology, quantum sensing, quantum state engineering, quantum information and communication and more fundamental quantum measurement process. He is also interested in quantum entanglement between atoms and photons, temporal mode characterization and engineering of photons, quantum noise of amplifiers. ",
