        "His research interests include multi-scale simulations of organic and organic-inorganic hybrid materials via combinations of quantum-chemistry approaches, condensed-matter physical models, and molecular dynamics simulations. His goal is to determine the nature of the physico-chemical mechanisms in organic and hybrid material systems leading, for instance, to: (a) strong luminescence or photovoltaic response; (b) efficient charge or spin transport behavior; (c) novel quantum properties for quantum information science."
